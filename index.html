<font size="5"><em><strong><h2>Why trash in space is a major problem</h2></strong></em>
<p>There’s a lot of trash on the Moon right now – including nearly<br>
100 bags of human waste – and with countries around the<br>
globe traveling to the Moon, there’s going to be a lot more,<br>
both on the lunar surface and in Earth’s orbit.</p></font>

<font size="5"><p>In August 2023, Russia’s Luna-25 probe crashed into the Moon’s surface,<br>
while India’s Chandrayann-3 mission successfully landed in the southern<br>
polar region, making India the fourth country to land on the Moon.</p></font>

<font size="5"><em><strong><h2>The problem of space junk</h2></strong></em>
<p>All this activity creates hazards and debris. Humans have left a lot of junk<br>
on the Moon, including spacecraft remains like rocket boosters from over 50<br>
crashed landings, nearly 100 bags of human waste and miscellaneous<br>
objects like a feather, golf balls and boots. It adds up to around 200 tons<br>
of our trash.Since no one owns the Moon, no one is responsible for keeping it<br>
clean and tidy.</p></font>
